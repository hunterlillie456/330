Javascript: syntax is like Java.
Scripting language: no compilation, only interpretation by JS engine in web browser 
Only programming 1 language running on Web front.
JS also can run on server 
Syntax between python and 
Java: not strong type-
checking
Variable: 
var x = 1;
x is visible globally 

let y = 2; accessible locally

Javascript can be embedded in a HTML document, or stand only but linked to 1+ html documents, similar to CSS.
<style>…<.style>
<link type=css/text rel=css href=fiel.css>

For JS:
<script language = javascript>
<script>

function fname(x,y)
{
	return x + y;
}

var name = function(x,y)
{
	return x+y;
}

Let i =100;
i %= 2; <====> i = i%2;
i += 3; <====> i = i+3;
Don’t say i equals i+3!

X === y really means x and y refers to the same memory location 
X == y <==> at some moment the values happen to be the same 
X = y
